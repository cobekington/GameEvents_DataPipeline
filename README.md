**Simplified Data Pipeline**

- **Tech Stack:**
    - Python
    - Kafka or a simpler message queue alternative (e.g., RabbitMQ)
    - A small database (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
    - Consider introducing Spark or a simple data processing library (pandas)

- **Concept:**
    - Simulate a stream of game events (e.g., player actions, match results).
    - Build a pipeline that processes these events:
        - Simple calculations (aggregations, win/loss ratios)
        - Stores the results in a database.
    - Consider a basic visualization element (charts using a suitable library)

- **Demonstrates:**
    - Building data processing and streaming concepts
    - Understanding of data transformation
    - Interest in analytics extraction
