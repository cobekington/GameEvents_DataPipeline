- **Tech Stack:**
    - Python (Flask or similar for a basic web backend)
    - Redis (or an in-memory database) for fast leaderboard storage and updates
    - WebSocket library (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time communication
    - A simple frontend (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)
- **Concept:**
    - Simulate game score submissions from multiple "players."
    - Maintain a leaderboard that updates in real-time as scores come in.
